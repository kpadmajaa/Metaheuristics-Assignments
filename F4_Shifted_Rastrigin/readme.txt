Metaheuristics
Implementation of the Genetic Algorithm
Implementation of the Genetic algorithm to solve the TSP problem.

Implementation choices:

Parent selection for cross-over using:

Selection by Ranking for N first individual then for the remaning selection:
Roulette Wheel Selection
Random initialization of the population

GA Stopping Criteria: no or marginal improvement for the last N solutions

Insertion Strategies: replace an entire population

Mutation: mutation can apply to all individual (according to the rate) except for the fittest individual.
